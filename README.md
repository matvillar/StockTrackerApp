# StockTrackerApp - iOS

StockTrackerApp is an iOS application for tracking stock prices and managing your investment portfolio. It allows users to search for stock symbols, view real-time stock prices, and add stocks to their portfolio for monitoring.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of creating StockTrackerApp was to enhance my skills as a software engineer, specifically in iOS app development. By working on this project, I aimed to gain hands-on experience in building a real-world application and to deepen my understanding of mobile app development concepts.

I also wanted to create a tool that would be useful for individuals interested in tracking their stock investments. StockTrackerApp not only serves as a learning project but also offers practical value to users who want to stay informed about their stock holdings.

## Development Environment

### Tools Used

StockTrackerApp was developed using the following tools:

- **Xcode**: Xcode is the primary integrated development environment (IDE) for iOS app development. I used it for coding, debugging, and testing the app.

- **Git and GitHub**: Git was used for version control, and the project is hosted on GitHub to facilitate collaboration and code sharing.

- **Swift**: The primary programming language for iOS app development is Swift. I used Swift to write the code for StockTrackerApp.

### Programming Language

The main programming language used in this project is Swift. Swift is a powerful and intuitive language specifically designed for developing iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS applications. It offers modern features and syntax that make it well-suited for mobile app development.

By using Swift, I was able to leverage the full potential of iOS development, including access to the iOS SDK, SwiftUI, UIKit framework, and various iOS-specific libraries and tools. This choice of programming language allowed me to create a responsive and efficient app that provides a smooth user experience.
